# Space Tourism Website

This is my a solution to the [Space Tourism challenge by Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3). 


### Requirements
My  goal was to build the site to match the figma design provided by Frontend Mentor.

I had to make sure that users can experience the following:
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## Teachnical details

I built the website using
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- A11y 


### What I learned
To be able to complete this project, I learned a range of new skills:
- Extensive use of variables for color, font-size, line-height, letter-spacing, and font-families
- Create responsive margins using the "clamp" function
- Use @supports
- Apply background effect with "backdrop-filter"
- Use "aria-selected", "role", and "aria-controls"

### Useful resources

Book: "Using SVG with CSS3 & HTML5" (Publisher: O'Reilly)- This is an amazing book which helped me understand working with SVG.
