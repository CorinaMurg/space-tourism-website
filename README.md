## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

Extensive use of variables for color, font-size, line-height, letter-spacing, and font-families
Create responsive margins using the "clamp" function
Use @supports
Apply background effect with "backdrop-filter"
Use "aria-selected", "role", and "aria-controls"

### Continued development

Continue learning about the use of pictures/images and appropriate CSS code for styling them.


### Useful resources

Book: "Using SVG with CSS3 & HTML5" (Publisher: O'Reilly)- This is an amazing book which helped me understand working with SVG.
